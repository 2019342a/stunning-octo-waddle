What is it?
-----------

Personal python cookiecutter to speedup my python projects. Contains a file structure that I like and a bare minimum of libraries that I commonly use.


Usage
-----

Install cookiecutter:

:code:`$ pip install cookiecutter`

Then run this command:

:code:`$ cookiecutter https://github.com/2019342a/stunning-octo-waddle`

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Python project will be created for you.

I would definitely recommend building your own cookiecutter project instead of using this one.
It is fun and you have your own custome template.
